## Project Overview (Highlights):
This project is designed for **LoyaltyFirst Inc.**, a retail music store looking to implement a fully functional customer loyalty program. The system helps track purchases, accumulate and redeem loyalty points, manage family-linked accounts, run promotions across branches, and support decision-making through data analytics.

The solution integrates a well-structured relational schema derived from an Entity-Relationship (ER) model. It also includes a complete backend SQL setup for schema creation and data insertion, along with advanced query sets and a Java-based GUI to execute SQL commands interactively.

## Project Files & Descriptions:

### `550 PROJ1_DOC.pdf`
**Purpose:** This is the primary documentation for Project Component 1.  
**Contents:** Contains the complete conceptual design approach including identified entities, attributes, relationship mapping, and assumptions. Also documents the evolution of the ER diagram through multiple drafts.

### `ER Diagram.pdf`
**Purpose:** Graphical representation of the ER model.  
**Contents:** Captures all entities (Customers, Cards, Products, Transactions, Prizes, etc.), attributes, and relationship types like many-to-many and one-to-many.

### `Project_2.sql`
**Purpose:** SQL script to create the database schema.  
**Contents:** Defines tables, primary and foreign keys, and constraints. Maps the conceptual model into a working relational schema ready for deployment.

### `insertions.sql`
**Purpose:** Sample data population.  
**Contents:** Inserts test data for customers, cards, families, transactions, products, offers, and redemptions. Includes examples with expired cards and shared family points.

### `queries.sql`
**Purpose:** Analytical and retrieval SQL queries.  
**Contents:** Includes 18 Oracle-compatible queries addressing common business requirements like point tracking, product analysis, and redemption history.

### `querydisplay.jar`
**Purpose:** Java-based GUI for SQL interaction.  
**Contents:** A Swing application that connects to the database and runs user-entered SQL queries. Displays results in a JTable view, supporting interactive database usage.

### `HA4.zip` and `loyaltyfirst.zip`
**Purpose:** Supplementary project packages.  
**Contents:** Likely include backup files, Java source code, or environment configuration necessary for running the GUI or other components.
